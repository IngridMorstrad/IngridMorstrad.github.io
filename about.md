Ashwin works as a software developer in Seattle, WA. He is over 25.  

He likes a lot of things - some may say *too* many. This blog may contain his thoughts on some of these things, or an explanation of what he most recently found interesting and why. He likes burgers and thinks the Big Mac is one of the best burgers around. He likes medium-to-large sized dogs.

He would love to hear your thoughts and comments and engage in discussions. Feel free to comment on the blogs.
