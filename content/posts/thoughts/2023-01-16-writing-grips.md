I was unaware that the different writing grips were named and catalogued! I found a list [here](https://www.ot-mom-learning-activities.com/correct-pencil-grasp.html). When I was young, I believe I used the dynamic quadropod grip and then in the seventh grade noticed that almost everyone was using the dynamic tripod grip. So, I learned how to write with the tripod grip as well.

Today, I use a mixture of both, with a bias towards the quadropod.
