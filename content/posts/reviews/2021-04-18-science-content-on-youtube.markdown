Some of my favourite science content on YouTube
[PBS Eons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA)
Covers life on earth, including some great videos about early humans.
[Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium)
Pretty cool science channel, where he explains different science phenomena. Based on his philosophy (from his PhD work) that showing people misconceptions and then correcting them is what gets them to learn. Showing the "truth" directly leaves them with the feeling that their preconceived (often incorrect) notions were right. He details this [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVtCO84MDj8)
[Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/user/onemeeeliondollars)
Engineer who builds some really cool, unique stuff. Most average views per video among all YouTubers.
[AronRa's Systemic Classification of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXQP_R-yiuw&list=PLXJ4dsU0oGMLnubJLPuw0dzD0AvAHAotW)
Playlist walking through the evolution of life by following a phylogenetic tree from the smallest organisms all the way to humans. Occasionally branches off to talk about other species too.
