title: Learning how to Learn
---

[Link to course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) (Now self-paced)  
University: UCSD  
Overall rating: 2/5  
Recommended if: you like self-help.  
Level: Easier than an intro  
Good: Organized, has a structure.  
Bad: Nothing that can't be learned by browsing the web while procrastinating.  
Interaction with other students: (3/5) Fair amount of discussion on the forums.  
Work assigned: (1/5) Just some written assignments. Don't feel like it really helped you *learn* the content (oddly enough).  
Lectures: (2/5) A bit like watching a documentary, except a little more academic. I'd rather get this info from a BBC documentary. The stuff that wasn't tested (interviews and such) were more interesting.  
My final score: Dropped out. Not worth it.
