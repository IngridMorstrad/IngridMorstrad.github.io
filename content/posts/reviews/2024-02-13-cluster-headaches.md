# Cluster headaches

I've always thought it would be a better use of time to do research on conditions rather than simply pray. In one case, after doctors had near given up on figuring out what was causing a family friend's son's high fever, said family friend read up and suggested that his son may have dengue to the doctors. Turns out he did - doctors had not tested for dengue because it wasn't dengue season.

Around 2017-2018 or so I started getting cluster headaches.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE and TALK TO A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INSTEAD.

Here's my personal summary of what could help (simply a collection, no comments  yet). Intended only for me to reference and track how cluster headaches are talked about online.

> I came to the conclusion that my headaches were caused by increased pressure on the trigeminal nerve inside my right nostril. I try to stay hydrated to keep natural moisture, but more importantly, I try to keep the nostril very clean. When I feel an initial symptom starting up, I get something wet (paper towel, finger, whatever) and start cleaning any excess buildup away from my nostril's inner wall.
