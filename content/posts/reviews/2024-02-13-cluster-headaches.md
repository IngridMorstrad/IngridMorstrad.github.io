# Cluster headaches

I've always thought it would be a better use of time to do research on conditions rather than simply pray. In one case, after doctors had near given up on figuring out what was causing a family friend's son's high fever, said family friend read up and suggested that his son may have dengue to the doctors. Turns out he did - doctors had not tested for dengue because it wasn't dengue season.

Around 2017-2018 or so I started getting cluster headaches.

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE and TALK TO A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER INSTEAD.

Here's my personal summary of what could help (simply a collection, no comments  yet). Intended only for me to reference and track how cluster headaches are talked about online.

Vitamin D3 program (google it or go to vitamindwiki.com). Also [on clusterbusters](https://clusterbusters.org/resource/d3-vitamin-therapy-and-loading-details/). Seems to be the most effective.

> I came to the conclusion that my headaches were caused by increased pressure on the trigeminal nerve inside my right nostril. I try to stay hydrated to keep natural moisture, but more importantly, I try to keep the nostril very clean. When I feel an initial symptom starting up, I get something wet (paper towel, finger, whatever) and start cleaning any excess buildup away from my nostril's inner wall.

## Possibly vagus nerve related

Interestingly, stimulating the Vagus nerve by going into the cold/applying. Massaging the back of the neck can also stimulate the Vagus nerve. Humming can also stimulate the vagus nerve. Sleeping on your right side (back is the worst). Devices like Gammacore for VNS. [link from a certified mental health professional licensed in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSN2CeDkslg)

> Ice cold slushies, water, etc. as an abortive. Applying cold/ice pack to the head.
