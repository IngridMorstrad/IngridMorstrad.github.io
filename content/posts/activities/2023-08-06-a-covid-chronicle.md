## The initial signs

Unfortunately, on the last day of a trip to Alaska, I started feeling a throat infection coming on. This was, however, not to be a simple throat infection.
A few hours after I'd gotten back home (a day later) a fever of 102.3 had built up.

## A citizen scientist

A day later, I decided this might be a good opportunity to chronicle the progression of the disease, and collect some actual data. I started recording my temperature, and the medicines I took. We've had a spike in citizen journalism with the advent of the internet, it would be nice to also have a spike in the number of citizen scienctists! Here's a quick summary of what the following days looked like, graphed:

The green dots indicate when I took medicines (details below).

## Interesting observations

I decided not to take medicines when my temperature was under 102, as I'd read some recommendations that it might be better to let your body do it's thing. A higher temperature lets the immune system function better. I noticed that medicines steeply bring down the temperature, but once it wears off, the body temperature rises as sharply. The third time I took medicine I took it just before the body temperature crossed 102, as I noticed the medicine took around an hour to take effect - the body temperature didn't drop till about an hour after I'd taken the acetaminophen.  

Temperatures didn't correlate with how I felt. I distinctly remember feeling better at 103 than at 102, and sometimes felt worse at 98 than 99. My core body temperature is usually lower than 98, so a 98.6 left me feeling somewhat feverish.

## Medicines taken

Day 1: ~11 PM. DayQuil  
Day 2: 11 AM. Acetaminophen  
Day 2: 8 PM. NyQuil  
Day 3: 5 AM. NyQuil  
Day 4: No medicine.  
Day 5: 9:30 AM. NyQuil half dose (couldn't take the headache).  

## Things I'd have changed
- NyQuil may screw around with your sleep. If you don't have difficulty falling asleep, I'd stick to plain acetaminophen.
- If you do have difficulty falling asleep, NyQuil might be alright, but I'd ensure you still stick to your nightly sleep schedule once your temperature is under control. I strongly think (in hindsight) if I'd kept a good sleep schedule around Day 3, I'd have recovered a day earlier. I only slept ~5 hours (Day 2 night) and though my temperature had fallen when I woke up, it quickly started rising. I made sure to sleep 8 hours the next day.
