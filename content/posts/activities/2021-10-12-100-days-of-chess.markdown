## Goal
The goal here is to try to do 100 days of chess study and see how that affects my games.

## Plan
Will pull from a list of resources I have. Will add books below as I decide to start tasks:
1. [book] Logical Chess: Move by Move by Irving Chernev.
2. [book/video series] My 60 memorable games by Bobby Fischer.

[MoveGuesser](www.moveguesser.com) to "learn" the GM games.

## Day-by-day logs
Day 1: 10/10 - First two games/chapters from Logical Chess Move by Move (by Irving Chernev). Both games were in the Giucco Piano.  
Day 2: 10/13 - IM Sowmya's explanation of Fischer's game against Sherwin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2QGuK2dLsA. Featuring the Sicilian, with white playing d3.

John Bartholomew's Chess Fundamentals: 4/5 done. The concepts are "known" to me, but for example, I fail to see hanging pieces, or misjudge if a trade is good or not during the game.
