Starting the February "review" a bit early this time, and going to state my goals, and track them more regularly (possibly every week). I think this gives me a good chance to pivot on goals as necessary. 

## Habit goals

- 22 minutes of reading every day. [Drop from Jan] Down from 30 minutes in January, which was a little too much for me. Again, counting only time spent reading books, not articles.    
- 10 minutes of walking per day. Decided not to change this one; added a running goal instead.
- 2 times a week running (for varying times). [New] Aim is to do 10 mins first week (continuing from January), 15 the second, 22 the third and 25 the fourth.  
- 5 chess puzzles in a row every day. [Same as Jan]
- 3 sets of push-ups every other day. [Change from Jan] Weighted, 3x11 with 2:00 rest between sets.
- 3 sets of squats every other day. [Change from Jan] Weighted, 3x15 with 2:00 rest between sets.
- [Secret goal]. Will be revealed later.

## Non-habit targets

- 500 correct chessCom puzzles for the month. Total of 2744.
  - *Week 1: At 2603.*
- [Added end of week 1] Finish reading & paste notes for Designing Data-Intensive Applications

And now,

## The results
*in the same order*:

To be filled.


### Week 1
- The book Blood, Sweat and Pixels by Jason Schreier is pretty good and to some extent makes one want to dabble in gamedev. In particular the stories of Stardew Valley (which I was a fan of before this) and Shovel Knight. The game studios seem like tough places to work at. However, reading while sleepy is not great for actually understanding the book.
- Running went better than expected, managed 14 & 15 mins, instead of 10. Could have run even more.

Overall, To be filled.
