After seeing others (Susan Fowler, Julia Evans, etc.) write year-in-review posts, I thought I should give it a go too! However, I don't trust my discipline to last all year. So, I've decided to post monthly reviews.

For January, I set the following goals, all framed in a 'habit' style.

- 30 minutes of reading every day. Reading was a fond childhood habit, which I have replaced with oodles of pointless Redditing, YouTubing and Twittering. As a kid, I'd carry my books along on visits my family made (serving the purpose of a comfort blanket, while also engaging me I guess). Time to get that back on track. I forced myself to only count time spent reading books, not articles.
- 10 minutes of walking per day. This is some indicator of how unfit I had become at the end of 2020, given that till 2019 I could easily run a 5k in under 28 minutes with little effort.
- 5 chess puzzles in a row every day. Intended to improve my skills at chess. Based on something I read on KhanAcademy (I think) stating that streaks of correct answers indicate mastery better than %-based metrics.
- 3 sets of push-ups every other day. 
- 3 sets of squats every other day. For both this and the push-up goal, I didn't really set a fixed amount of reps per set. This may be something I change going forward.
- Watch 2 tech videos every week day. This goal was abandoned after 4 days. I need to fit 'learning' into my schedule in a different way.

And now,

## The results
*in the same order*:

*7 days in a row to begin, then missed the next 6! Only 6 misses after that, a big win for me since this was the toughest goal I felt.*  
Managed to finish a couple of books (A river in darkness and [A little history of philosophy](/posts/reviews/2021-01-28-a-little-history-of-philosophy/), and around half a book more (parts of The Story of Philosophy and Blood, Sweat and Pixels). This one was tough, since I usually read before bed, and 30 minutes before bed feels extremely long. May split it up into reading 10 minutes during the day and 10 minutes at night (or similar).

*Missed 3 Fridays (!!)*  
Barely feels like a goal, but considering my fitness level, was good motivation to get me out the house. Likely also reduced my food delivery bills, as I walked to pick food up instead.

Started on the 12th:

*Missed 2 days, both Saturdays (**hmmmm**)*  

Started on the 3rd/4th:

*Missed 1 day*  
![Squat Habit](/assets/images/SquatsHabit.jpeg)
*Missed 1 day*  

Midway through the month, I'd also set a few other non-habit goals:
- Run ten minutes twice (towards the end of the month, once my fitness was back up)
  - *The first ten-minute run was much harder than the second one. Will increase the duration next month.*
- 15x3 push-ups (one day)
  - *Was just right.*
- 20x3 squats (one day)
  - *Was somewhat easy, but squats were giving me knee problems.*
- 4100 chessCom puzzles (I was at ~1200 when I started)
  - *Cleared this (at ~4200 now), although next month I'll track the number of puzzles solved successfully instead.*
- Write 3 blogs
  - *At 2 blogs with this one, which I am fine with since I had forgotten about this goal.*

Overall, I am pretty pleased with the results. I feel like my chess has improved and my fitness is slowly improving.
