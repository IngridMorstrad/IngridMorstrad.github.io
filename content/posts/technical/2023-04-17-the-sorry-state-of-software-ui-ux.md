# The sorry state of software: UI/UX

## Can you tell the time?

<insert clock imag/>
Nope, you aren't looking at a programmer's [attempt at being funny](https://techcrunch.com/gallery/worst-volume-controls/). This was the **official** clock app on Android.

This was actually an attempt at improving the earlier iteration, which for some godforsaken reason stuffed the hours from 13 to 24 into the clockface displaying 1-12. Inexplicably, 00 is included in the inner clock face, meaning the inner clock face actually goes from 00 to 13. I'm perplexed how this was released to customers. And really, why even update a "clock" app? Surely, it can't be improved anymore... [or can it?]()

## Why is software UX so bad?
Most software engineers are completely alien to the idea of user experience (UX). Heck, I myself did not know how it differed from UI until I had a UX designer as a colleague, who patiently walked me through what UX is, how it matters and how UI ties in to it.

In the last decade, with organizations growing and mixing in more product managers in an attempt to scale, software engineers are either not expected to or not allowed to take ownership of the product. This is in part driven by the commoditization of software as engineers end up being given smaller and smaller roles so that trying to do the right thing takes exceptional effort to even attempt to convince the decision makers. As an organization grow larger, there is a growing disconnect between the product being built and the people doing the building. In addition, career paths are so strictly defined and narrow that this further kills motivation and the desire to learn or innnovate. 

Businesses are built to return a profit. Quite often, there is a lot of short-term thinking here, and a great desire for profit in the short-term. If good UX comes in the way of this, or cannot be proven to help, it falls by the wayside. Software also suffers from "feature-itis". The addition of "new" features above and beyond everything else, in (a usually futile) search for new business models, means the UI is further stuffed with unnecessary features in the hope the customer clicks on it (unfortunately, we're all driven by [dopamine](https://www.ashwinmenon.com/posts/thoughts/2016-08-22-love-drugs-and-rock-n-roll/)).

Lastly, large corporations are likely monopolies, and without good regulations, a monopoly won't listen to customers nor build good products anymore. There are [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/qk2xzd/am_i_the_only_one_a_little_annoyed_clicking_the/) examples of customer complaints, but unfortunately they fall on [deaf ears](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/194080895?pli=1) 

## What does good UI/UX look like?
Good UX is whatever makes it easier for the customer to do the right thing. The right thing here means whatever the customer opened the app/software to do, and not what the software/app may want to trick the consumer into doing. Good UI is whatever enables this UX. In addition, good UI makes it HARD for the user to do the wrong thing.

## Good UX example: The Square Cash app
Here's a screenshot of an older version of the Square Cash app. See how it launches you right to the payment screen, and clearly presents two options (request & pay), which is likely all you need.
  
This is a seemingly simple product, but look at how one of their competitors went about it:

Admittedly, this may have helped them win and keep market share thanks to network effects, but it's worth calling out that a product that is used more is not always a better product (blog post on this coming at some point).
