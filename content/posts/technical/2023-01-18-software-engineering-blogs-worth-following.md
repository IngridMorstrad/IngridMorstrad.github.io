Here's a list of some cool blogs I think are worth a read:

### Software engineers
_Approximately in the order I'd recommend them in_
[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)  
[Marc Brooker](https://brooker.co.za/)  
[Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)  
[Steve Yegge](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/)  
[Cindy Sridharan](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/)  
[Vaidehi Joshi](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi/) - not really a blog, but the basecs and baseds series.  
[Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/)  

Unranked: [Carlos Arguelles](https://carloarg02.medium.com/) (haven't gotten to it yet)

Will add more as I find more worth adding here.
