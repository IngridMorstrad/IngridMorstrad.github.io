## The case for the curmudgeon

A curmudgeon is that one person(s) on the team that seems to always have something to complain about. While today there are calls for more positivity in all spheres of life, I'm going to make a case for why having a curmudgeon on your team might actually be a _good_ thing.

Firstly, a curmudgeon ends up creating a safe space for others on your team to raise concerns. If a curmudgeon's constant complaining is tolerated, other employees may feel more comfortable sharing any concerns they have, bringing transparency and openness in communication to the workplace. Handled well, this can lend some hard evidence to support the oft-heard phrase "Bring your entire self to work" (with the unsaid second half: "without worrying about it"). Psychological safety [based on research by Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/identify-dynamics-of-effective-teams/) was shown to be the number one factor impacting the effectiveness of a team.

Complaints also provide a valuable source of negative feedback, which can be hard to get. For problems to be fixed, they need to be found and highlighted, and I'd say no one finds problems better than a curmudgeon. Dealing with a pool full of problems is better than dealing with an empty one that you're trying to fill.

Lastly, their complaints belay a truth they may not share openly - they really do care about the work and the workplace, and they want things to make better for everyone.

## Beyond tech
This applies more generally too. People who have negative things to say may have a very valid reason for saying those things. Even if the things that are being said are not valid, there may be an underlying systemic flaw that causes those feelings of hurt/negativity.

## Additional notes
The definition of curmudgeon as stated here does not include those that "bully" others (or constantly raise complaints about other people rather than about the work/process of working). I think Robert Sutton did a good job naming those that bully others in the workplace.

A curmudgeon would differ from a cynic in that a cynic does not believe that people are up to any good. A cynic's opposite would be a "Yes-man".

[John Carmack](https://www.engadget.com/john-carmack-leaves-meta-043202664.html), many such [examples](https://isocpp.org/blog/2014/11/functional-carmack). Here's [another](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/john-carmack-sounds-a-skeptical-note-over-metas-metaverse-plans/), oversteps into what may be bully territory at times.  
Steve Yegge, whose most famous rant was [this one on platforms](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/22wi/papers/yegge-platform-rant.html). Yegge has so many that his [blog](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) is called "Stevey's Blog Rants".  
Casey Muratori, ranting [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC-0tCy4P1U) about Visual Studio. Many other rants too.  
Jonathan Blow, [one example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5s965qdmyU).
