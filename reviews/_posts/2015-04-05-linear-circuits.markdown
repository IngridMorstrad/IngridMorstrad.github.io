[Link to course](https://www.coursera.org/course/circuits)  
University: Georgia Institute of Technology  
Overall rating: 4/5  
Recommended if: You want to know what would be taught in your first circuits course in college or are just interested in refreshing what you learned about circuits.  
Level: Intro  
Good: Covers and explains the basics in an easy to understand manner. Discussion forums were helpful. Lots of numerical problems to ensure you understand a decent amount.  
Bad: Some topics are glossed over - like transformers and the wheatstone bridge. The lab is weak and boring, when similar courses have much better labs. Proofs and derivations are sacrificed in lieu of just providing a formula, more so as the course progresses.  
Interaction with other students: (4/5) A lot of interaction on the piazza forum, mainly due to a few students who were very active answering questions. An instructor goes through the forum fairly frequently too.  
Work assigned: (4/5) A good amount of homework and a quiz for each lesson too. Some homework questions (the "select all that are right" type) seem a little confusing and unnecessary. Though, everything considered, doing the work will help you understand better.  
Lectures: (3/5) Slides with an instructor speaking over them. Nothing too fancy, but not too shabby either.  
My final score: 100%
