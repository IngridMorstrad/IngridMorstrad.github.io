      <p><em>Disclaimer/Foreword: The aim of writing this series of posts is to allow our modern interview processes to be viewed through the lens of history (chronicling the process) and science (identifying problems and inferring improvements from process changes). This is part two in the series, which will focus on how to maximize your chances given the current state of the system. The rest of this post assumes you&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.ashwinmenon.com/posts/thoughts/2022-01-21-tech-interviews-an-origin-story/">part 1</a>, and are interested in interviewing for tech/big tech companies.</em></p>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>In 2020, I gave a few (&lt; 5) interviews, and failed every single one. In 2021, I gave quite a few more (~10), and got an offer from almost every company. This is my catalogue of what helped me improve my performance, with the hope that it may help you as well. Please let me know if it did!</p>
<h2 id="training-for-the-sport-of-interviewing">Training for the <em>sport</em> of interviewing</h2>
<p>The extreme gamification of tech interviews<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --> means that nowadays, interviewing is basically a <em>sport</em>. So, to have good results when interviewing, one needs to prepare like a sport. This means identifying the few things that maximize your success given the time you have, and repeatedly drilling yourself with those things till you are in good shape to play &ldquo;the final&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll list some of these things, and provide the amount of time I think you need to spend on each. The list of items is sorted from least important (at the top) to most important (at the bottom). If you have a limited number of days remaining, skip the items at the top. It is critical to get to the items at the bottom, so, if you find yourself short on time, start moving down the list quicker.</p>
<h2 id="the-training-plan">The training plan</h2>
<h3 id="a-positive-disposition-and-mental-strength">A positive disposition and mental strength</h3>
<p>Probably the easiest thing to do to maximize your chances, while also possibly the most dismissed area is simply, to be positive. During the interview, having a positive disposition can cause interviewers to bias the interview in your favor (see <a href="https://www.ashwinmenon.com/posts/thoughts/2022-01-21-tech-interviews-an-origin-story/#:~:text=Bias%20is%20the,not%20be%20affected">part 1</a>). A solution that may have been dismissed with &ldquo;Candidate could not find the most optimal solution&rdquo; may instead be written up as &ldquo;Candidate solved the question in time, and given more time I expect they would find the most optimal solution.&rdquo;. Gayle McDowell also refers to this in her book, using something along the lines of, &ldquo;make yourself a person the interviewer would want to go grab a beer with&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On occasion, you may run into an interviewer with a bad disposition. It is crucial that you maintain a positive attitude and keep your focus on solving the question. In 2020, I was really, <em>really</em> put off by a few interviewers who were completely uninterested in the interview (unfortunately not an uncommon situation). In 2021, I worked on it by actively trying to stay interested in the problem even when an interviewer was off-putting. While practising, I also scheduled interviews with friends who played the role of an antagonistic interviewer (maybe unintentionally 😉). Even if you decide you do not want to be a part of the company, you&rsquo;re better off giving it your best shot and rejecting them later (as things may change - you may like the team/get a great offer/not get any other offers).</p>
<p>Another aspect to being mentally strong is to avoid &ldquo;spinning&rdquo; in your head. In 2020, at times I&rsquo;d find myself <em>stuck</em> and not able to think of a solution, with my mind going over the information I&rsquo;d already gained, somewhat on auto-pilot. At that point, I knew mentally the interview was done. I&rsquo;d keep spinning for however long the interview was going to last, and my mind was going to spend more effort whining about the interview process than trying to gain insights that would lead me to the solution. In 2021, I tried to account for this while practising questions. Each time I&rsquo;d start to spin, I tried to push myself to find some new information that could help. It worked more often than not.</p>
<p>Keeping a positive attitude can also help you stay mentally strong (disciplined). While preparing, it&rsquo;s easy to feel like practising puzzles on Leetcode is degrading or beneath you, but given the possible returns (i.e. the reason you started doing this) it&rsquo;s good to have a positive approach to the whole thing. While I practised, I &ldquo;fooled&rdquo; myself into thinking that solving Leetcode puzzles was the most fun thing I could do in the moment, by repeatedly telling myself how much fun this was. This made grinding the problems every single day much, much easier.</p>

<td style="text-align:center"><em>I also made some graphs like this to gamify preparation itself</em></td>

<p>In short, keep the above points in mind (heh) while practising. Consciously make the effort to practice improving on all of these fronts. Like in tennis, you&rsquo;re the only one out there on the court. You have to be coach &amp; candidate all in one.</p>
<h3 id="resumes">Resumes</h3>
<p><em>Time to spend: ~3 hours</em><br>
Resumes don&rsquo;t matter too much. I see a lot of people spending days making their resumes look good, but there&rsquo;s no value in spending more than a few hours on this, tops. Try and be quantitative (use numbers to show how you delivered value) when elaborating on projects. Before submitting resumes to recruiters, get a couple of friends to give you feedback on your resume. Finally, before on-site rounds, go over what projects you put in your resume (in case interviewers want to dive a bit deeper), and refer to those projects in the behavioral round (see below).</p>
<h3 id="landing-interviews">Landing interviews</h3>
<p>The best way to get interviews is to have recruiters reach out to you. You can encourage this by setting your LinkedIn profile to &ldquo;actively looking&rdquo; and messaging recruiters and managers (especially ones that say they are hiring). The second-best way is to get people to refer you, which is why having a network <em>really</em> helps (and may also partly explain the weird demographics of the tech world). Everything else (like applying on companies&rsquo; websites) is near pointless. I&rsquo;ve had auto-rejections from company websites and then had a recruiter reach out to me later, don&rsquo;t waste your time.</p>
<h3 id="mock-interviews">Mock interviews</h3>
<p><em>When to schedule: throughout the process, at intervals</em><br>
Mock interviews are super important and under-utilized. The right way to use mock interviews is to schedule as many of them as you can, and schedule them frequently, soon after you start preparation. In 2020, I waited till I thought I was &ldquo;ready&rdquo; before scheduling mock interviews. But, by then, the feedback I got was too late. Mock interviews let you know how well-prepared you are, and what areas you need to work on (always ask the interviewer for feedback!). Feedback is <em>very</em> important - change your preparation plan based on the feedback. For example, if the mock interview contained a question from a Leetcode list you&rsquo;d done (see the Leetcode &amp; company-specific preparation sections below for more info), and you did not get it, drill the entire list again!</p>
<p>To schedule mock interviews, you can use websites that conduct mock interviews (<a href="www.pramp.com">Pramp</a> is free, and <a href="https://iio.sh/r/S8J6">www.interviewing.io</a> lets you do one for free). Even better, if you have friends in tech, ask if they can conduct mocks for you. Having some &ldquo;harsh&rdquo; mock interviews serves as good preparation, as some real-life interviewers may be quite strict when evaluating. Mock interviews with friends are great because they can give you honest, detailed feedback. Lastly, given the nature of the game<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, you can use real interviews with companies as mock interviews for other companies.</p>
<h3 id="the-dreaded-design-round">The dreaded design round</h3>
<p><em>Time to spend: ~3 months</em><br>
Design is a tough nut to crack. You aren&rsquo;t going to significantly improve your design knowledge in a month or two. However, any time spent reading the basically-a-distributed-engineering-manual &ldquo;Designing Data-Intensive applications&rdquo; by Martin Kleppmann, <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Scalability-Startup-Engineers-Artur-Ejsmont/dp/0071843655">Web Scalability for startup engineers</a> and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HusseinNasser-software-engineering">Hussein Nasser&rsquo;s</a> excellent YouTube channel is time well spent. These should help you with your software engineering career in general, while also possibly aiding with interviews.</p>
<p>Design interviews are hard to prepare for as they vary widely between companies. Some company-specific preparation (see section below) may help you plan for the design round in a more effective manner. A few companies will ask you to design popular websites. For these kinds of interviews, you can use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/codeKarle">CodeKarle&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a>, which goes into great detail on many systems, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfaWHOrITI&amp;list=PLK8IOvtbwVsuYW8KovGg9o6dlhspym8O_">this playlist</a>. Grokking the Coding interview (on educative.io) is also recommended, but be alert reading it, as it contains a lot of errors, and handwavy explanations (that may not fly in real-world interviews). The main goal of most design rounds is to gauge breadth, so try and cover the entire system at a high level before diving into any particular component.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the design round can go poorly no matter how much you prepare for it. It could end up being a case of &ldquo;have you and your interviewer read the same resource?&rdquo; or in some cases &ldquo;does the interviewer have enough experience/knowledge to know what approaches could work?&rdquo;. Luckily, given that design is usually a focus for more senior roles, you might do better to focus on another area that is also important for senior roles:</p>
<h3 id="the-behavioral-round">The behavioral round</h3>
<p><em>Time to spend: ~1-2 weeks</em><br>
I used to think of behavioral interviews as the easiest rounds. One you didn&rsquo;t really need to prepare for, as could simply bluff your way through it (not lie, really, but let&rsquo;s say you want to be a bit selective with the truth). However, today, I believe you do need to practice for these. One thing I learned in 2021 (thanks to some help), was that all questions in the behavioral round have another question hiding behind them, and <em>that</em> is the question you need to answer. This &ldquo;underlying question&rdquo; may not be entirely obvious. For example, when asked about a conflict at work, the point is not about the conflict at all, but rather to paint a picture of how diplomatically you handled it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how poorly the other party in the conflict acted, the question seeks to unearth whether you will be pleasant and amicable under <em>every</em> situation. It isn&rsquo;t lost on me that preparing this way is a little beauty pageant-esque, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>So, how do you get better at behavioral interviews? You could ask friends in non-technical roles for help, especially ones that have conducted or given many such interviews. Or you could practice with your recruiter (a lot of recruiters are open to this, as your performance ties into <em>their</em> performance). For some questions, I prepared a couple of possible answers (using examples at work), and had recruiters help me with which ones to use. Once you have the answers you are going to use for each question, drill them by repeating them to a friend<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or even a mirror, until you can say them confidently while having a positive disposition. Interviewers (on account of being human beings), will have unconscious biases, and you want those to fall your way. Confident, well-articulated and positive responses are likelier to get a positive outcome, assuming other factors are similar (I can&rsquo;t find too much fault with this, as software engineering <em>is</em> a social profession - in most cases, you need to work well with others to do your best work)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Behavioral interviews are also a great way to illustrate the kind of scope you had in your role (for example, if your conflict was with a director versus an SDE 2 😉), meaning you improve your interview performance significantly without requiring the time investment other skills (design, coding) do. Probably because more senior roles involve more non-technical skills, the behavioral interview becomes more important the higher you go, so investing time here should pay off in the long run.</p>
<h3 id="leetcode">Leetcode</h3>
<p><em>Time to spend: &gt;= 2 months</em><br>
If you want to clear interviews across the industry, it&rsquo;s no secret that you will have to buck up and go heads down into Leetcode. A good pace to set is to solve around 2 medium-hard difficulty problems per day until you hit ~100-200 medium-hard problems solved (aiming for 200 is safer). The aim here is primarily to familiarize yourself with the set of problems that get asked, and secondarily to get better at solving new, unseen problems. Get Leetcode premium ~1 month before the interview and solve all the questions in the &ldquo;by company&rdquo; list for the company you are interviewing for, sorting by frequency (most of these questions should have been done if you&rsquo;ve hit 200 problems). Once you&rsquo;ve solved all the questions, solve them again. The standard you want to hit is being able to solve a problem in 10 minutes flat from seeing the question to coding up the solution, and having it run with no errors on the first try. A good tool to aid with this is spaced repetition. Repeatedly solve the problems a few days apart - especially the ones you found hard, and at a more granular level, note down common errors that prevented the code from compiling (for example, using Anki - a flashcard system) and drill yourself on those. For example, I&rsquo;d always forget the order of parameters for &ldquo;String.join&rdquo; in Java or whether an array&rsquo;s length was a field or a method (things an IDE usually helps me with). Using Anki sorted this out so well that even if I got to use an IDE in an interview, I didn&rsquo;t need to spend any time on it.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also want some practice with tackling new problems. This will help you practice <em>thinking</em> of solutions from scratch, which should help when you come across an unfamiliar question in an interview. Just knowing that you are capable of tackling <em>any</em> problem is a big confidence boost that can improve your interview performance. I&rsquo;d probably go with a 80-20 split between doing problems for familiarization versus for improving thinking. As your interview dates get closer, spend less time on trying to come up with solutions to problems yourself. When doing problems to build familiarization, give yourself 20 minutes at most (the usual length of an interview), and soon start cutting it down to 5. When doing problems to practice thinking, take as much time as you need (especially if the interview is some time away).</p>
<p>If you find that the problems are too hard, try solving some easy problems to build up momentum (spend 20-40 minutes on each problem). If easy problems are still too hard, start reading the solution &ldquo;actively&rdquo;. Meaning, you stop reading the solution as soon as you think you gained enough information to make some progress. If you get stuck again, continue reading the solution. Once you&rsquo;ve got an idea of how to solve the problem, it is <em>very</em> important to solve it immediately (and then return to it again a few days later, i.e., leverage spaced repetition). A few other tips to keep in mind when solving problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you come across a problem that uses a common algorithm (like depth-first search or recursion with memoization), and you struggled with it, find a few more problems under that category and solve them.</li>
<li>If you find a problem that seems to be a part of a series (usually labeled with a &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;2&rdquo; at the end on Leetcode), solve the entire series.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t over-optimize! There&rsquo;s no need to get the most-optimal solution. Of course, it is great if you can, but your focus should be getting a working, correct solution first.</li>
<li>Read the forums to find other solutions that may improve upon your code. However, you may not want to use algorithms with fancy tricks that the interviewer may not understand (provided there are other algorithms as optimal).</li>
<li>Write clean code, with proper variable names always. This gives you a good gauge of how long it will take you to actually solve the problem, and is good practice for all interviews.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t hack your way through the problem. Think of a solution from start-to-end and then begin coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people may think they need to start from scratch by reading an algorithms textbook, but that is the wrong way to go about this. You need practice solving problems, and you&rsquo;ll gain the skills you need to solve more problems by following the approach mentioned here (reading solutions &ldquo;actively&rdquo;). However, if you don&rsquo;t have time to do a lot of problems, then fine-tuning/over-fitting your preparation for the company in question is your best bet.</p>
<h3 id="company-specific-preparation">Company-specific preparation</h3>
<p><em>Time to spend: ~2 days (per company)</em><br>
Not frequently listed, but company-specific preparation is probably what gives you the biggest bang for your buck. The best way to go about this, is to go to the Leetcode forums, Glassdoor or Blind, and check for what the company values. Some companies will want you to code bug-free without ever touching the &ldquo;Run code&rdquo; button, while others want you to run your code frequently (similar to how you code at work) and use an IDE. Some will want you to walk through the code line-by-line to demonstrate its correctness, while others will want you to write out testcases instead.</p>
<p>In addition, go through questions others have posted, that they may have been asked. Once you find relevant posts, try and solve the problems in code. Do <em>not</em> just read the problems and solutions<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Once you identify questions that are likely to be asked, repeatedly solve the questions (as stated in the previous section). For some companies, you can find their entire interview list online! The reason this happens is that companies attempt to calibrate their interview questions across candidates. This usually means that questions that are asked have to be from a limited pool of questions<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you have completed the previous steps, you should have completed most problems on Leetcode under &ldquo;by company&rdquo;, meaning this section should take only a couple of days.</p>
<h2 id="in-short">In short</h2>
<p>For an SDE 1 level, you can skip the design section, spend ~2 days on the behavioral section and spend all your remaining time on the Leetcode section.
For an SDE 2 level, you should spend 1-2 weeks on the design section, half a week on the behavioral section and 2-3 weeks on the Leetcode section.
For an SDE 3 level, you should spend ~2 months on the design section, 1-2 weeks on the behavioral section and 2-4 weeks on the Leetcode section.</p>
<p>Lastly, you should plan on doing <strong>nothing</strong> the day before the interview. As a professor once told me, &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t gotten to it by the last day, you&rsquo;re probably not going to be able to really get it on the last day either&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve done enough. Wind down and relax instead. You got this!</p>
