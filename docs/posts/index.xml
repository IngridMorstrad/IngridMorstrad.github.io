      <description>In a stark departure from my usual posts, here is some utterly unscientific nonsense that I mull over from time to time:
You can convince people to believe you are great, if others simply keep repeating that you are. What&amp;rsquo;s even more surprising, is that you can even do this without the help of others. Simply praise yourself all day, everyday, and take credit for accomplishments that have involved great help from others.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer/Foreword: The aim of writing this series of posts is to allow our modern interview processes to be viewed through the lens of history (chronicling the process) and science (identifying problems and inferring improvements from process changes). This is part two in the series, which will focus on how to maximize your chances given the current state of the system. The rest of this post assumes you&amp;rsquo;ve read part 1, and are interested in interviewing for tech/big tech companies.</description>

This series will contain 3 parts: the first one (this post) describes how interviews got to be the way they are today, the second will describe how you can maximize your chance of success at these interviews, and the third will talk about suggestions to improve the process and fix some of the issues plaguing tech interviews.</description>

      <description>Goal The goal here is to try to do 100 days of chess study and see how that affects my games.
Plan Will pull from a list of resources I have. Will add books below as I decide to start tasks:
[book] Logical Chess: Move by Move by Irving Chernev. [book/video series] My 60 memorable games by Bobby Fischer. MoveGuesser to &amp;ldquo;learn&amp;rdquo; the GM games.
Day-by-day logs Day 1: 10/10 - First two games/chapters from Logical Chess Move by Move (by Irving Chernev).</description>

      <description>I got to use the Open AI Codex API today, as part of the Open AI codex challenge. The challenge consisted of 5 problems, meant to be solved as quickly as possible, with the Codex available for help.
Clicking the &amp;ldquo;Codex it&amp;rdquo; button would get Codex to &amp;ldquo;parse&amp;rdquo; the problem statement, the comments in code and the method signature. Following that, it would write code that solved the problem. For the problems in the contest, the generated code either solved the problem completely or required only minor changes (&amp;lt;= 3 lines).</description>

      <description>Having worked for a little over six and a half years as a professional software engineer, now may be a good time to reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and how I&amp;rsquo;ve grown.
Company 1 In my first role, I primarily worked on implementing bug fixes and small features. While I feel bug fixes are not well considered by the industry, I really enjoyed working on them. They work as great on-boarding tools, allowing developers to come in and simply implement the fix or can also be great tools for learning the code-base.</description>

      <description>After basically taking all of March &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; (only did Week 1, and lost my records for that week), hoping for a more productive April. Mostly porting March&amp;rsquo;s goals over.
Habit goals 10 minutes of walking per day. [Same as Feb]. Third month in a row. 2 times a week running (for varying times). [Slight change from Feb]. Tracking two 5Ks a week by week 3. [Paused] 3 chess puzzles in a row every day.</description>

      <description>Some of my favourite science content on YouTube
PBS Eons
Covers life on earth, including some great videos about early humans.
Veritasium
Pretty cool science channel, where he explains different science phenomena. Based on his philosophy (from his PhD work) that showing people misconceptions and then correcting them is what gets them to learn. Showing the &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; directly leaves them with the feeling that their preconceived (often incorrect) notions were right.</description>

      <description>Over my career as a software developer, I&amp;rsquo;ve changed how I approach code reviews. Simply put, I think of code in more practical terms and less as an &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo;. Concepts of beauty, and perfection are best left to be incrementally achieved, and should always be considered with the end goal in mind (delivering value to the customer). Below, I&amp;rsquo;ve included my post from 3 years ago, with edits.
This here is a collection of things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about reviewing code in the few years that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a software developer.</description>

      <description>Started the February &amp;ldquo;review&amp;rdquo; a bit early this time, stated my goals, and tracked them more regularly (aiming for every week). I think this gives me a good chance to pivot on goals as necessary.
Habit goals 22 minutes of reading every day. [Drop from Jan] Down from 30 minutes in January, which was a little too much for me. Again, counting only time spent reading books, not articles. Modified to read 1 chapter (of DDIA) per day on Feb 13.</description>

      <description>After seeing others (Susan Fowler, Julia Evans, etc.) write year-in-review posts, I thought I should give it a go too! However, I don&amp;rsquo;t trust my discipline to last all year. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to post monthly reviews.
For January, I set the following goals, all framed in a &amp;lsquo;habit&amp;rsquo; style.
30 minutes of reading every day. Reading was a fond childhood habit, which I have replaced with oodles of pointless Redditing, YouTubing and Twittering.</description>

      <title>A little history of philosophy by Nigel Warburton</title>

      <guid>/posts/reviews/2021-01-28-a-little-history-of-philosophy/</guid>
      <description>Overall rating: 9/10 Recommended if: you want to start reading about philosophy Level: Easy, intro-level.
Summary In short (heh), a great introduction, covering a lot of philosophers. I liked it better than whatever I&amp;rsquo;ve read of The Story of Philosophy. Sometimes I wonder if Nigel accidentally misrepresented/misfocused what philosophers stood for to ensure transitions between chapters were smooth (for eg:- I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Locke contrasted with Hobbes in the past, but could draw no such contrast here).</description>

      <description>Drug prices are similar to the points in &amp;ldquo;Whose Line is it Anyway?&amp;rdquo; - they&amp;rsquo;re made up. The price that is shown in the infographic (250$) is purely artificial, considering the drug maker gives a $62.50 rebate, meaning the actual cost to the drug maker is only $187.5.

Textual description What happens is, the company that makes the drug sets a price, let&amp;rsquo;s say 250$ (this is a &amp;ldquo;fake&amp;rdquo; price as you will see).</description>

      <description>With all the recent news and coverage that climate change is getting, it is easy for one to get a sense of ennui, to develop a numbness to each new report that paints a grimmer version of the future compared to the previous one. It is easy to feel helpless, as if relying on the ability of a captain on a sinking ship. This post is written as an attempt to try and get you to disavow that notion.</description>

      <description>“Woah!” he chortled.
“I look different, I guess.”
“You look like a writer.”
I hadn’t seen Ashish for quite some time. We went to the same school, but only struck up a friendship towards the end of high school. We lived awfully close (less than a km away from each other), but it was only by the eleventh grade that my parents deemed I could walk a kilometer safely by myself.</description>

Wolf Einstein The wolf has realized you&amp;rsquo;ve foiled his initial plans, and he&amp;rsquo;s decided to up his game. Now, he knows you encrypt your message with your private key. He decides he will decrypt the message with your public key, which will let him know exactly when you plan to visit.

However, the big bad wolf is aware of your plans, and he decides he will also write a letter to your grandmother (pretending to be you) saying you won&amp;rsquo;t be visiting. If only there was a way you could let your grandmother know your letter was from you and the wolf&amp;rsquo;s letter was a fake.</description>

      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a few thoughts about charity floating around in my head. This post is a way for me to record some of those thoughts.
Deciding where to give For me, this has been the most important question when donating any money/time/effort. If you have X dollars to donate, where should you donate this money?
Goal 1: Effective allocation No one wants to see their money wasted. The primary concerns I had were that the money would not be used appropriately (either the charity is a front for a scam, or just inefficient in the way it utilizes funds).</description>

      <description>Introduction They say &amp;ldquo;necessity is the mother of invention&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s incredible the power programming gives you. Maybe if the power-hungry learned how to program they could be constructive rather than destructive. Then again, the recent Facebook scandal makes you wonder.
The problem Stepping down a few rungs and we&amp;rsquo;re back to the little world I live in. For the past few days/weeks, I had been frustrated by the lack of mailbox space at work.</description>

      <description>Background At work, during breaks, most of my team plays table-tennis. This weekend, I decided to spend some time writing up a rating system that I could use to keep track of how good (or bad) I (and everyone else) was. This is a writeup of how that exercise went. I&amp;rsquo;ve hidden a few lines to act as spoiler (indicated by an arrowhead to the left of the line). If you wish to exercise your mathematical skills, try making a guess and then click the line to reveal how I solved the problem.</description>

      <description>Intro For a large part of my life, from when I was about 10 years old till I left college, I used to take part in quizzing competitions. A couple of times, I&amp;rsquo;ve had people ask me how they could start quizzing, or what preparing for a quiz would entail. This is a question I have some difficulty answering, because I have never really prepared for a quiz. In fact, procrastinating while trying to prepare is pretty much how I learned some of the different tidbits that have helped me win different quizzing competitions.</description>

      <title>A guide to code reviews</title>

      <description>This here is a collection of things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about reviewing code in the few years that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked as a software developer. As these are my thoughts, you should take them with at least a pinch of salt instead of at face value, as with most subjective things in life.
When I first started, I reviewed code very differently from how I review code now. Despite this being a very important skill, it is not taught in high school or even college.</description>

      <title>My weird walk to work</title>

      <description>The walk Intro I&amp;rsquo;m sure a few other people do, or try to do this, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how unusual it is, but I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post about it regardless. I walk to work. Almost everyday. And usually (like a good engineer ;) ), if I do something repeatedly, I try to optimize it. With code, with life. So, now that it&amp;rsquo;s been a few months of walking to work in Seattle, I think I can present my learnings.</description>

      <title>H*cking around</title>

      <guid>/posts/technical/security/2017-09-23-hacking-around/</guid>
      <description>Intro People think hacking requires a great deal of skill (on the part of the attacker) and/or a great deal of skill (on the part of the defender). This is quite clearly false. There are many simple ways to exploit a system. In this post, I detail some of the times I got access to accounts I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been able to get access to. While these are not the specific ways that a system&amp;rsquo;s bugs are taken advantage of, in general the principles hold true.</description>

      <description>Intro As part of efforts to improve security, my workplace has issued us Yubikeys. What is a Yubikey? It&amp;rsquo;s a device you plug into your computer&amp;rsquo;s USB port and when you touch it for a few seconds, it spits out a string. This string is used for authentication (to identify you). The device has a capacitive sensor to detect touch, just like most phones today (old phones that used a &amp;ldquo;stylus&amp;rdquo; use resistive-touch based on resistors).</description>

      <description>Intro I write this article to provide an easy way for people just entering the workforce (many of my friends) to manage their finances. I also think this article would also be a good reference for me, and may prove interesting (in hindsight) in a few years. If you want to spend as little time as possible, skip to the end. I would appreciate comments if you find this useful.</description>

      <description>Part 1 As an Indian watching the Olympics, there is not much to look forward to. The best in our one billion-strong nation don&amp;rsquo;t make it past the qualification criteria for most sports. And, when they do, they are usually found at the bottom of the standings - forming a solid base from which, every Olympics, we moan the dearth of infrastructure and the deluge of corruption in India.
The list of medals won per capita at the Summer Olympics has India finishing last in Total Medals per Capita, Gold Medals per Capita and second-to-last (woot!</description>

Love I was never insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched
Edgar Allan Poe Love - a feeling succinctly defined by the Oxford dictionary as &amp;ldquo;an intense liking for another person&amp;rdquo;. An emotion intense enough to form the backdrop of literary and cinematic tragedies - Romeo and Juliet, Joel and Clementine and my personal favourite, Eloisa to Abelard*.</description>

      <description>Sprint: To race or move at full speed (Dictionary.com)
Given the above definition, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t surprise you that the fastest cyclists in a match sprint reach speeds as high as 70 km/h. Watching the event may leave you confused - it looks like they are fighting to lose the race. The sprint shown below looks, at times, like a slow-cycling event:
What&amp;rsquo;s happening here is that being in second-place, right behind the leader, reduces drag (friction with the air) by quite a large amount - around 30%.</description>

      <description>Dinosaurs.
Intro - Archosaurs We begin the journey around 250 million years ago, at the end of the Permian era, marked by the largest mass extinction in Earth&amp;rsquo;s history. The Permian-Triassic extinction event was catastrophic, claiming around 90 percent of marine life and 70 percent of life on land. Synapsids, animals that dominated the Permian landscape, were all but wiped out. A few trickled through, biding their time to regain their kingdom in a later era, but for now what was important was that life had entered the Triassic era - albeit barely.</description>

      <description>Asterisks are explained at the bottom.
Intro Sports - activities where people try to prove they are better than others at an activity they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be caught dead doing otherwise. Outside the world of sports, it would be ludicrous to find 11 people running behind a ball, but say you can do it better than any other set of 11 people, and the world will throw millions at you. While they might seem stupid if you try thinking about the higher purpose in the purpose of sports, you would be hard pressed to find someone not tuning in for the big final.</description>

      <description>The idea The other day, while surfing Reddit, I came across a few comments that said having a 55% chance of winning a point would give you a 99% chance of winning the game. I&amp;rsquo;d heard this before, but this time I thought, &amp;ldquo;Hey! I can simulate that and see if it makes sense.&amp;rdquo; Seemed a bit unrealistic to me, that 50% would mean dead-even whereas 55% would mean a blowout.</description>

      <description>Ran my first race on May 2nd. A 20 km run around Lake Monona.
Started off too fast - too confident despite not having trained since the end of March. Soon, I was tired enough that I would end up walking not insignificant distances throughout the race. Even with all the walking and the pleasant weather, 20 km was really exhausting. Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s a Wisconsin thing, but two pints of beer is what you get after you cross the finish line.</description>

      <description>Link to course
University: Georgia Institute of Technology
Overall rating: 4/5
Recommended if: You want to know what would be taught in your first circuits course in college or are just interested in refreshing what you learned about circuits.
Level: Intro
Good: Covers and explains the basics in an easy to understand manner. Discussion forums were helpful. Lots of numerical problems to ensure you understand a decent amount.
Bad: Some topics are glossed over - like transformers and the wheatstone bridge.</description>

      <description>Link to course
University: University of Alberta
Overall rating: 4/5
Recommended if: You are mildly interested in dinosaurs, evolution or animals. Also, if you would like to know what paleontologists do.
Level: Intro
Good: A great intro to dinosaurs and paleontology. The instructors take feedback seriously and have changed the course since the first offering.
Bad: Wish it went into more detail and was more challenging. It felt like a course without a lot of college level content.</description>

      <description>Link to course (Now self-paced)
University: UCSD
Overall rating: 2/5
Recommended if: you like self-help.
Level: Easier than an intro
Good: Organized, has a structure.
Bad: Nothing that can&amp;rsquo;t be learned by browsing the web while procrastinating.
Interaction with other students: (3/5) Fair amount of discussion on the forums.
Work assigned: (1/5) Just some written assignments. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it really helped you learn the content (oddly enough).
Lectures: (2/5) A bit like watching a documentary, except a little more academic.</description>
